        <p>Mabuhay, everyone! &#9995 </p>
        <p>My name is Gizelle. I'm a Filipina and I currently live in Utah(Utah Valley). I'm currently working on my degree in Applied Technology. I speak English, Tagalog, and Hiligaynon.
            Two things that I love the most are technology and history. I enjoy learning everything about computers and data science. I love visiting museums! 
            I've been to some big museums in the United States. I recently visited the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. 
            My loving husband and I got married last year, and it's been wonderful since day 1. &#128151 </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>I have a degree in Information Technology from the Philippines. I plan to continue my IT career in the United States but I want to focus in programming this time.
            I have created simple websites in the past using HTML and CSS but I still need to improve it. I think it's a very
            useful skill because a lot of things now are accessible through the internet. I want to continue to improve and earn more skills in computer and web development.
            I'm grateful that I have this opportunity to take online classes at BYU-Idaho. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints since birth. I'm in the third generation
            of Church members in the family. I served my mission in the Philippines Iloilo Mission.
            My favorite quote is from President Thomas S. Monson. He said, <i>"Never let a problem to be solved become
            more important than a person to be loved."</i></p>
