                <article>Art by Kim lets you explore the world through its art collection!
                    <br><br>
                    Our artist, Kim, is a traveler and explorer. 
                    He has captured the different cultures, scenery, and nature in his paintings and sketches. 
                    He started to love painting as a young boy who wants to keep the memory of his travels 
                    using his watercolor and sketchpad, instead of photography. He has traveled to different 
                    parts of the country where he had most of his art collections. Some of these places are 
                    Colorado, Chicago, Hawaii, Arizona, Florida, Utah, and many more. Everyone is free to 
                    browse his art collection and fall in love with the scenes. We are selling his art 
                    collection for a good price.
                    <br><br>
