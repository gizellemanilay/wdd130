          He does watercolor paintings, oil on canvas paintings, and beautiful leather crafts. 
          You will see his artwork through this website
           and can even order some of his ready-made paintings and crafts online. Go visit our website 
           and indulge yourself in great arts and crafts!</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <p>Whether you're on your desktop or your mobile phone, you can check Kim's artworks and leather art!
        We welcome those who are local art collectors, artists, and even those who love some paintings to
        design their homes. We also welcome those who are looking for leather arts and those who want their 
        own customized leather product.

      Our artist, Kim, is a traveler and explorer.

        young boy who wants to keep the memory of his travels using his watercolor and sketchpad, instead of photography. He has traveled to different 
        parts of the country where he had most of his art collections. Some of these places are Colorado, Chicago, Hawaii, Arizona, Florida, Utah, and many more. 
        Everyone is free to browse his art collection and fall in love with the scenes. We are selling his art collection for a good price.
